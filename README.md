# FindExecutable
C# code to find the full path of an executable file by searching the system's search paths.

The code was previously part of [SGrottel's Tiny Tools Collection (https://github.com/sgrottel/tiny-tools-collection)](https://github.com/sgrottel/tiny-tools-collection).

## Code
The code is located in the `FindExecutable` subdirectiory.

### Example
`FindExecutable` is a static class with one public static method:
```cs
public static string? FullPath(
	string executable,
	bool includeCurrentDirectory = false,
	bool includeBaseDirectory = false,
	IEnumerable<string>? additionalPaths = null);
```

* `executable` -- The name of the executable to find.
* `includeCurrentDirectory` -- If set to true, the current execution directory is included in the list of search paths
* `includeBaseDirectory` -- If set to true, the application domain base directory is included in the list of search paths
* `additionalPaths` -- If set to something other then null, the paths iterated within are included in the list of search paths

The function will return the full file system path to the executable file requested, or null if the file is not found.

A description of how the function performs it's search can be found in the function comment in the source code.

### How to Add to Your Project
You can simple copy this directory and all it's files to your project.

Or, you can use the `SGrottel.FindExecutable.nuget` to import the files into your project.
This way, if you manage your dependencies with tooling, you can be automatically informed about updates.
